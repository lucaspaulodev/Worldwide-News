# Worldwide News - Simple news search interface ðŸ“°

With the advent of the 2020 pandemic, being well informed has become a necessity.
However, along with this need, knowing where to find reliable news has become extra work for people, as the risk of getting fake news has also increased.
So, to make it easier to find real news, I decided to create an application that finds it for me, without requiring much effort.
To get the news, the application uses the <a href="https://newsapi.org/">Google News API.<a>
